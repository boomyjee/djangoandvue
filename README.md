Awesome test website



## Development

### Running docker compose

+ run `docker-compose up --build`

You also may need to use `sudo` for running docker - depends on a way you installed docker and on the OS you use.

After successfull run the app can be access in [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

### Login and test data

On first running, there will be creating a test superuser with email `superuser@example.com` and password `superuser`. You can use these credentials for login inside the app and inside the [admin panel](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin).
